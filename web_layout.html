                    <p>I like moving things 1mm to the left. And the back again. Until it is perfect.  The way a website feels and looks is important, as is its functionality. We all know those websites that most likely work perfectly, but we never want to go there again (why was it so ugly, why was nothing aligned, none of the buttons made any sense…) </p>

                    <p> I think a website like this can be likened to the ‘ugly girl’ at the dance.  She might have a great personality (functionality), but she never gets that first chance at love or even a dance because she lacks in the looks department (the face of the website), and has an awkward social manner (user experience). </p>
